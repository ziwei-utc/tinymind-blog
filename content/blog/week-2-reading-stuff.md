# 段食

2026年 1 月 12 日 8:40 AM，重启我的生命系统。
依据 2016 年诺贝尔奖揭示的“细胞自噬”原理，我开启了第三次 72 小时轻断食。

很多人问：你已经连续 2000 多天 4:30 起床，读了 3000 多本书，事业稳定，为什么还要对自己这么狠？ 
我的回答是：因为我想更好。

1、身体的复利： 长期的高频运动和科学饮食，让我拥有远超常人的精力。

2、心力的跃迁： 经过无数次挫折的洗礼，我的心力变得越来越强，能更冷静地面对每一个高压决策。

3、生命的逆龄： 这种极致的自律，让我感受到了身体的“返老还童”。

72 小时断食，不是为了减脂，而是为了追求极致的清醒与强悍。 
在这个不仅要活得久、更要活得好的时代，我选择不断向上兼容。 
致敬每一位在路上的奋斗者。💪

# 说话

商界的一位大佬曾与我说：
拿捏人性的八个方法，记住了没人敢惹你。

1、沉默的力量。

当别人言语挑衅你，不要急着解释反驳。学会看着对方的眼睛，保持了秒钟的沉默，再轻轻说一句：“你确定要这样说吗？”这种沉默会让对方感到不安、自我怀疑，甚至自己找台阶下。心理学研究表明，沉默比争辦更有威慑力。

2、问题反弹术。

当有人试图给你施压或提出不合理要求，别急着回答“是”或“不是”，而是把问题抛回去：“你为什么会这样想？”或者“你这个要求的依据是什么？”这会迫使对方解释自己的立场，转移压力，让你掌握主动权。

3、情绪分离法。

别人冲你发火时，乎静地说：“我理解你现在很生气，但我们能否先冷静下来再讨论。”这一句话，立刻把你的情绪和对方分离，让对方意识到自己情绪失控，而你依然理性。记住，谁先情绪失控，谁就输了。

4、确认结束句。

当不想继续某个话题或争论时，看着对方眼睛，微笑着说：“这件事到此为止，我们没必要再讨论了。”然后立即转移话题。这种果断的态度会传递出强烈的边界感，让人不敢越界。

5、责任回归法。

当有人试图甩锅给你，马上说“我理解你的立场，但这个问题的关键在于如何解决，而不是找责任人，你有什么解决方案吗？”这一句话既不揭锅，又不撕破脸，还把皮球踢回给对方。

6、时间缓冲术。

面对棘手请求，不要立即答应或拒绝，而是说：“这个问题比较复杂，我需要考虑一下，明天给你答复。”这给了你思考的空间，也让对方知道你不是随意敷衍，而是慎重对待。

7、选择限定法。

当别人强制你做选择时，记住永远给自己第三种选择，比如对方说非A即B时，你可以说：“我理解你提出的选项，但我认为还有C的可能性”，这样既不正面冲突，又不被限制在对方的框架里。

8、底线预警术。

当感觉被冒犯或即将被过分要求时，提前划清界限：我尊重你的想法，但这触及了我的底线”，这句话传递出你有明确的自我边界，让人不敢轻易僭越。掌握这八条人性话术，不是为了操控他人，而是在这个复杂的人际关系中保护自己;当你能够识别并应对他人的心理策路，你就能立于不败之地;记住，真正的强大不是咄咄逼人，而是在任何情况下都能保持自我，不被他人轻易影响，这些话术背后是你的自信和边界感。

# 教育

关于孩子的教育：学习的第一性原理是自学，而不是补课，自学的第一性原理是归纳与总结，而不是耗时间，总结的第一性原理是自我输出，而不是机械抄录，输出的第一性原理是表达与重构，而不是简单重复，表达的第一性原理是逻辑而不是形式，逻辑的第一性原理是理解而不是模板，理解的第一性原理是实践而不是止于理论。

Why 2026 Is a Mathematically Special Number

Neither a square nor prime number, 2026 is still intriguing

Mathematics
Number enthusiasts may be looking to the new year with a touch of melancholy. Another perfect square like 2025 (452 = 2,025) won’t occur again until 2116 (462 = 2,116). The year 2027 will be a prime number. By comparison, our current year, 2026, seems almost boring. But that’s a misconception.


The On-line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), a kind of Wikipedia for numbers, contains more than 200 entries for “2026.” This means that the number appears in more than 200 number sequences. Some of these entries are quite obscure for nonexperts, such as one that relies on an understanding of a five-cell von Neumann neighborhood. Fortunately the OEIS reveals plenty of more accessible and entertaining mathematical quirks linked to the number 2,026.

Among other things, 2,026 belongs to the group of almost prime numbers because it only has 1, 2, 1,013, and 2,026 as divisors—narrowly missing the chance to be a prime number. It can also be used to generate a prime number. It’s part of a sequence that collects prime numbers of the form 50…077. Thus, 577, 5077, 50077 and 5000077 are prime numbers. A prime number in this sequence is 5 × 102026 + 77—that is, 5 followed by 2,026 zeros plus 77.


The Magnetic Towers of Hanoi
The number 2,026 is related to an extension of the classic mathematical game the Tower of Hanoi. In the original game, there are three poles with disks of different sizes, each with a hole at its center. At the start of the game, the disks are placed on the first pole from largest to smallest, starting with the widest at the bottom. The goal is to move all the disks to the last pole with them arranged in the same order—but each disk may only be placed on a larger disk, never on a smaller one. It can be proven that solving the game with n disks requires at least 2n – 1 moves.

Many variations of this puzzle exist. In one particularly popular version, the disks are magnetic, with the top side representing the north pole and the bottom side representing the south pole. When you move a disk from one rod to another, you reverse its orientation: the north pole is then at the bottom. And because like poles repel each other, you now have to ensure not only that a disk can be placed on top of another one based on its size but also that the orientations of the disks are correct. This makes solving the puzzle considerably more difficult.

As it turns out, when starting with eight disks, you need at least 2,026 moves to solve the magnetic version of the Towers of Hanoi. (By contrast, if you start with three disks, you can solve the puzzle in just 11 moves.)


An Unlucky Year?
Superstitious readers should skip this section. The year 2026 could prove unlucky—at least for people who pay attention to the frequency of Friday the 13th.

Every calendar year has at least one month in which the 13th falls on a Friday—but never more than three. And 2026 is one of those years in which there is a Friday the 13th in three months: February, March and November.


This frequency last occurred in 2015. If you don't remember all the terrible things that happened in that year, Wikipedia offers a list of natural disasters that occurred. Let’s hope the list for 2026 is shorter.

A Cheerful Number
To end on a positive note, it should be mentioned that 2026 is a so-called happy number, as popularized by British mathematician Reginald Allenby. Although there are infinitely many happy numbers there are also infinitely many sad ones. To find out which category a number belongs to, you first have to square the individual digits of the number and then add them together. That calculation for 2,026 is 2² + 0² + 2² + 6² = 44.


Then you repeat this calculation with the result 4² + 4² = 32, perform the calculation again with that result and then repeat the calculation two more times. This gives you the results 13, 10 and 1. The number 1 is the end point of the calculation, and it characterizes a cheerful number: any number that eventually ends at 1, according to the aforementioned calculation, is called happy.

Sad numbers, such as 37, on the other hand, have a different fate. For example, the calculation for 37 is 3² + 7² = 58. Continuing the calculation from this result, you arrive at 89, 145, 42, 20, 4, 16 and finally land back at 37. Sad numbers are thus trapped in a loop from which there is no escape. The only way for this calculation to end is if it eventually reach the number 1.

It’s Time to Stand Up for Science
If you enjoyed this article, I’d like to ask for your support. Scientific American has served as an advocate for science and industry for 180 years, and right now may be the most critical moment in that two-century history.

I’ve been a Scientific American subscriber since I was 12 years old, and it helped shape the way I look at the world. SciAm always educates and delights me, and inspires a sense of awe for our vast, beautiful universe. I hope it does that for you, too.

If you subscribe to Scientific American, you help ensure that our coverage is centered on meaningful research and discovery; that we have the resources to report on the decisions that threaten labs across the U.S.; and that we support both budding and working scientists at a time when the value of science itself too often goes unrecognized.

In return, you get essential news, captivating podcasts, brilliant infographics, can't-miss newsletters, must-watch videos, challenging games, and the science world's best writing and reporting. You can even gift someone a subscription.

There has never been a more important time for us to stand up and show why science matters. I hope you’ll support us in that mission.


Thank you,

David M. Ewalt, Editor in Chief, Scientific American
