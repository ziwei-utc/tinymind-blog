Do I Need to Do Anything if I Don’t Want to Make Any Changes? 

It’s important to note that for MOST plan options*, if you do not want to make changes to your benefits, you don’t have to do anything during Annual Enrollment. If you don’t make changes, you will be enrolled in the same plan options for medical, dental, vision and disability products you are enrolled in now. 
* Flexible spending accounts require you to enroll each year.  To enroll in flexible benefits, go to optumbank.com/Tennessee during the annual enrollment period. 

Enrolling or Making Benefit Changes 

Enrollments, changes, cancellations and review of current insurance selections are completed online in the State’s Edison system. During the annual enrollment period, employees can access Edison via My IRIS Web without having to remember your Edison ID and password.  
To access Edison, sign into the IRIS web portal at https://irisweb.tennessee.edu/irj/portal using your UTC ID and password and click on the Edison folder on the top right area of the browser.
